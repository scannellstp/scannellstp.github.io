            <h2 class="section-heading">Planning the trip</h2>
            <p>As part of my responsibilites for co-director of the internaional division, my co-director and I were tasked with planning the Board trip.  After a voting process in the Spring of 2018, we decided to go to Japan.  This provided some logistical difficulties becuase</p>

            <p>We had no contacts that we could reach out to in Japan.  To begin we looked up the University of Notre Dame's alumni club in Tokyo.  This provided us with a couple of names we could reach out to.  From this group, we were able to schedule several company visits
            with companies such as Louis Vuitton, Abbot, and Kobelco.  On the cultural side, we began looking up popular tourist attractions in Tokyo.  We were able to develop a rough schedule and honed it in from there.</p>
            <p>Domestically, we also had to get through the process of collecting the student contribution, setting up the safty meeting and making sure that the travel was approved by Notre Dame's International department 
            and the Student Activities Office. Once we got through the all of that logistic planning we got waited for the travel date to arrive.</p>
            
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">The trip</h2>
            <p>
              We flew out on Sunday the 14th of October and arrived on Monday the 15th due to the date change.  We then checked into the hotel and spent that evening unpacking and decompressing after the flight.  Tuesday morning we met with a Notre Dame Alumnus who worked at Kobelco, a construction equipment company.
              They have a very distinctive color scheme of royal blue and are very prevelant in Japan.  We learned about Kobelco's business in Japan and that the equipment being used to build the 2020 Olympic games was made by them.  Later that day, we visited the Edo Tokyo Museum and learnt the history of the Tokyo
              regions history predating the city we know today.  On Wednesday, we went on a day trip to see Mount. Fuji and some of the cultural sites surronding it.  Unfortunately though, the weather was not cooperative and we were unalbe to get any views of the mountain.  The cultural sites were extremely interesting
              including a ninja village and a rural Japanese town.

            <span class="caption text-muted">A group picture in the rural village</span>
            <p>Thursday, we had two visits, both with Notre Dame Alumni.  In the morning, we visited a professor and discussed Federal Service Officers and their career paths.  That afternoon, we visited Louis Vuitton's headquarters in Japan.  At Louis Vuitton, we
              learned about building a brand and how LV maintains its supply chains while cartering to different cultures and demographics.  In addition to this, we also learned about LV's intellectual property division and how it combats the counterfeit market 
              present in Asia especially.  The group found this visit especially interesting, as we learned about the common signs of a counterfeit as well as some of Louis Vuittons.  For example, Louis Vuitton belts and sunglasses only use flathead screws.  Any
              other type of screw is a sign of a counterfeit.

            <p>
              Our last company visit took place on Friday, when we visited Abbott. At Abbott we learned about differences between health care from Japan to the United States.  One of the major differences being that Japan has a public health care system as opposed
              to the semi-private health care system present in the United States.  Because of this, Japanese people on average make over double the number of visits to the doctor that Americans.  We also learned about the process of working with the government
              through approving new products for the public.
